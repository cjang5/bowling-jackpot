#Todo list
+ Don't allow no name for bowler creation (im guessing this applies to leagues as well)
+ Link up functionality for Add-to-league and Add-to-lottery for bowlers
+ Start drafting League view based on this view
+ Maybe automatically select new bowler post-creation? Good UX :)
+ get options in pseudo-nav up floated to the right
+ Transitions?
+ Don't let user search for nothing in Search bowler
 + Also don't allow negative values
+ ~~Handle which buttons to show in client.pseudo-nav based on which view you're currently in~~
 + Do this for every view
+ Figure out Dashboard button styling, place in between ? and Options
 + can change later, but placeholder is in
+ Catch incorrect logins/failed registration
 + Add the dialog that will pop up - maybe tooltip? or div under button?
+ Finalize Registration modal
 + Automatically login after successful registration
+ For sidebar, highlight current view
+ Link modals to js
+ Decrease sidebar size when expanded
+ find BG images for carousel slides
+ decide on a color scheme
+ Make logo
 + Then put logo in navbar-brand
+ start prototyping UI for lottery/league creation
+ Create tooltip(?) or modal for help dialog
+ Create rest of landing page
+ create footer
+ Allow 'Enter' press instead of clicking 'log in' or 'sign up' in modals
 + look into jQuery .keyPress() for this..?
 
##Completed
+ ~~in register modal, employ green highlight/checkmark for correct password criteria/email~~
+ ~~Hover highlight for 3D buttons~~
+ ~~Dropdown menu for options button~~
+ ~~Dropdown trigger on hover~~
+ ~~Change width of options dropdown to fixed amount rather than vw~~
+ ~~Create logout button~~
 + ~~Link to JS~~
 + ~~make it visible/invisible depending on user status~~
+ ~~Test scrolling with fixed pseudo-nav by making ul list in bowlers-view~~
 + ~~Make create-bowler-button add new li to ul list~~
 + ~~Once figured out, add styling to list~~
 + ~~Then link client GET/POST requests~~
+ ~~Create helper functions showCreate, showCurrent, showDefault for handling show()/hide()s... this is getting messy~~
